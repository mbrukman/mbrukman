# Hey there!

I'm [Misha][about], I enjoy building software for both fun & work. I've created
or contributed to a number of [open-source projects][open-source] over the
years; hopefully, you'll find some of them useful.

Check out [my blog][blog] for some thoughts and explorations in tech and
beyond.

See you around!
